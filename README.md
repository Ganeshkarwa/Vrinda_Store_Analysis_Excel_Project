# Vrinda_Store_Analysis_Excel_Project

  The project titled 'Vrinda Store Report 2022' aimed to help the store create an annual sales report, analyze customer behavior and boost customer sales.

I performed various tasks such as **data cleaning**, **processing**, **analysis**, **visualization** and **report creation**.

The project also answered important questions such as: -
- How do sales and orders compare using a single chart?
- Which month had the highest sales and orders?
- Who purchased more, men or women in 2022?
- What are different order statuses in 2022?
- Which are the top 5 states contributing to sales?
- What is the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders?

 Based on the report insights, here are the outcomes of the sales: -

 1️⃣ Women are more likely to purchase (65%) than men.
 
 2️⃣ Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh were the top contributors to sales (35%).
 
 3️⃣ The adult age group (30-49 yrs.) made the most contributions (50%).
 
 4️⃣ Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels were the top contributors (80%).

🎯 The final conclusion to improve store sales is to target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs.) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.
